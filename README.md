# Real Estate Price Prediction Website

## This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a Real Estate Price Prediction Website. It combines machine learning, backend development, and a responsive frontend interface.

### Key Highlights

	1.	Model Development
	•	A prediction model is developed using Scikit-learn and Linear Regression, utilizing the Bengaluru home prices dataset from Kaggle.
	•	The process includes:
	•	Data loading and cleaning.
	•	Outlier detection and removal.
	•	Feature engineering.
	•	Dimensionality reduction.
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
	•	Model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation.
 
	2.	Backend Development
	•	A Python Flask server is implemented to handle HTTP requests.
	•	The server integrates the trained model to provide price predictions via API.
 
	3.	Frontend Interface
	•	The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	•	It allows users to input details such as square footage and the number of bedrooms, then displays real-time price predictions fetched from the Flask API.

### Technologies and Tools Used

	•	Python for backend development and model creation.
	•	NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing.
	•	Matplotlib for data visualization.
	•	Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
	•	Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs.
	•	Python Flask for API development.
	•	HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend design.

This project covers essential data science concepts, backend development practices, and frontend integration to deliver a complete solution.
