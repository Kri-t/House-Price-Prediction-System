Real Estate Price Prediction Website

This project showcases a step-by-step process I followed to build a Real Estate Price Prediction Website. The project combines machine learning, backend development, and a responsive frontend interface. Here’s a breakdown of the components:

Key Highlights:

	1.	Model Development:
	•	I built the prediction model using Scikit-learn and Linear Regression, leveraging the Bengaluru home prices dataset from Kaggle.
	•	The process included:
	•	Data loading and cleaning.
	•	Outlier detection and removal.
	•	Feature engineering.
	•	Dimensionality reduction.
	•	Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
	•	Model evaluation with k-fold cross-validation.
	2.	Backend Development:
	•	I created a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests.
	•	The server integrates the trained model and handles API requests for price predictions.
	3.	Frontend Interface:
	•	The user interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	•	Users can input features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and receive real-time price predictions via the Flask API.

Technologies and Tools Used:

	•	Python for backend development and model building.
	•	NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.
	•	Matplotlib for data visualization.
	•	Scikit-learn for machine learning.
	•	Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs.
	•	Python Flask for creating the HTTP server.
	•	HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend design.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of data science concepts but also gave me hands-on experience in end-to-end development, from data preprocessing to deployment.
